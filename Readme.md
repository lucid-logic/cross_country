# Excel Spreadsheets for School Cross Country Timing

## Background

This method will allow multiple age groups to be run in waves and waves can be started before the previous waves finish

A stopwatch records the time taken between waves and another stopwatch records the time the runner runs since the beginnning

For example a runner may be running in wave three and complete the run in 12 minutes. Waves have been run 15 minutes apart so wave 3 started at 30 minutes so their time on the stopwatch will be 42 minutes (2 x 30 + 12)

The may be the first in that wave but may recieve token 60 (as 59 people from wave 1 and 2 have already finished before them)

The excel will record them as 12 minutes (42 minutes deducting 30 minutes for wave 3 start) and put them in 1st place for that age group (wave)

People from different waves can finish in between each other and the system will not care

## Pre Race day Prep

Download the Excel Spreadsheet

In each of the age-grade workbooks fill in the student details (boys columns A-E, Girls columns L-P)

Print out tokens from the token excel spreadsheet.

Print out each age group page so placenumber can be recorded on the day.

## On the day

[Download a suitable timing app] (https://volunteer.parkrun.com/principles/virtual-volunteer)

Run the app on two phones and on both phones use the timing mode.

Phone A is for the timekeeper. Phone B is for the starter.

When the first wave starts, start the timer on both phone A and B together at the same time. The running time on both phones should be very close.

As each person crosses the finish line phone A should record a time. Phone A should have as many records as there are total students running

A token is given to the runner as they cross the line. Token 1 is given to the first person, number 2 to the second etc. The first person in wave 2 will not get 1 they will get they absolute order they cross the line. E.g. if 25 people in wave A have already crossed the first person in wave 2 will get 26.

The person takes their token to the results table and the position number is recorded next to their name.

As each wave starts phone B should record the start time. Phone B should have as many records as there are waves (Age Groups)

At the end of the race stop the timers on both phones and share the records via email.

## Entering data into the spreadsheest

Paste the wave time data (From phone B) into the Waves worksheet (you may need to shift the rows down a row so 0 is 0:00:00)
Confirm the Wave Adjust at the top of each age group worksheet is correct.

Paste the timekeeper data into the timing worksheet

Enter the tag numbers for each age group into F and Q columns

The resultant times and age group placings should then be calculated
